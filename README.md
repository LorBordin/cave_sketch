## 🚀 What is CaveSketch?

CaveSketch is a simple, fast, and mobile-friendly app built with Streamlit that helps cavers generate survey plots **directly from TopoDroid's `.dxf` files**.

Whether you're in the field or just back at base camp, you can:
- 🖨️ **Export clean PDF maps and sections** from your TopoDroid sketches.
- 🌍 **Place cave maps on satellite imagery**, using known GPS coordinates.
- 📱 Use it **directly from your phone** — all you need is an internet connection.

No Csurvey, no QGIS, no headaches.

## 📸 How To Use

### 1. Export your sketches from TopoDroid as **.dxf** files
   - From the project main window in TopoDroid, tap on the Sketch Editing button <img src="imgs/topodroid_icon.png" style="width: 20px;"> and select the cave map
   -  Tap on 3 buttons on Top Left and tap `Export`
   - Select the DXF option and tap on `Save`
   - In the same way export the cave section

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="imgs/map_export.jpg" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="imgs/export_format.jpg" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="imgs/section_export.jpg" style="width: 200px;">
</div>


### 2. 🗺️ Create the survey on the map
   - Upload the exported DXF files on the app. Notice: there is no need to upload both files, in case you are interested only on the map or the section.
   - Customize the settings (scale, text size, rotation, etc.)
   - Click **✨ Generate Survey Plot**
   - If you are satisfied, download your **PDF**!

### 3. 🌍 Position the cave map on satellite imagery.
   - add known GPS points for survey stations to georeference your map.
   - add as many knwon points as you want (the more the better)
   - click on **🌍 Generate Geo Map** to generate a satelite view map.
